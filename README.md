## Hi there 

Hi, I'm Aman Agrawal!

I always have a lot to write, when it comes to machine learning and related stuff! Mostly you'll find me reading or sharing my learnings on topics related to AI. I like to think and solve problems via a First Principles thinking approach.

I have built projects in the field of NLP and GenAI. I have industry experience in the AI domain through my internships in the NLP and GenAI field. I believe in the concept of build-in-public, so you'll find me an active guy on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@amannagrawall002), [Twitter](https://x.com/r4plh), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r4plh/) learning and sharing knowledge. I am also a contributing author at various publications including Towards Data Science.

I write articles on topics related to Data Science, ML/AI on Medium. Please feel free to see my work here! To connect via mail - amannagrawall002@gmail.com
